										<h3>What's going on here?</h3>
										<p>(a) We apologise for our hastily planned campaign. It has since been shelved and we will cooperate fully with the police enquiry. #TeamBantshire</p>
										<p>(b) We apologise to our Vice-Chancellor  for this unfortunate photo taken of him during a chat with Geography graduates. The words behind him actually said “pratique rend parfait in a hard employment”.</p>
										<p>(c) We’re cock-a-hoop to be ranked in the Top 601 in the WTF More University Rankings, for our Carbon Neutral Closed Loop Collaborative Consumption Fair Trade Canteen Facilities.</p>
										<p>(d) We are sorry if you have received a copy of our 2020 prospectus with this profanity on page 169. This is following a dispute with our printers.</p>

							<p><strong>Bantshire University is a crack at satire, obvs.</strong> But these are awards are totes legit. We understand the importance of handling your data correctly, GDPR, DPA, and all that shit. We've done the online training at work. Entries into the competition via our Google Form will be stored in Google Drive only, and can be accessed by only one person (our 'Chief Pixel Arranger') using a super secure password (Passw0rd1) and two factor authentication (like a bank or something). As soon as the competition is over, the data will be permanently deleted from Google Drive - after it is uploaded to the dark web (jokes, I won't upload your data to the dark web).</p><p>Please don't nominate people into this competition who won't get the joke or may be easily fucking offended. Any of the info you're about to submit may be posted to Twitter. Winners will be DMed an electronic copy of their trophy, and a congratulations from our Vice-Chancellor if he can be bothered.</p><p>Bantshire University is run by an absolute lad who works in higher education. It's a parody and not to upset or troll anyone, you snowflakes. We love higher education, but equally enjoy the idea that in an alternate universe there is a university as bad as Bantshire. Or maybe in this universe.</p><p>
