<p><h2>The prospectus drop</h2></p>

<p>Jenson woke with a start. His bedside clock said it was 6:39am. But what day was it? He hazard a guess at Thuenaday, so he dragged himself out of bed. </p>

<p>After eating more of his stockpiled pasta for breakfast, he sat down at his work laptop and struggled to remember his password. </p>

<p>What was his job anyway, he thought to himself. Something to do with outreach or payroll? Maybe he worked in security? He took a final punt at Head of School.</p>

<p>It had been almost 16 days since he was last in his office, and all he could remember were vague flashes of his colleagues’ faces. </p>

<p>After finding his password scribbled in Sharpie on his left hand, he prepared for his first Skype, or Zoom, or Hangout of the day. He couldn’t remember which software his university used, but nonetheless he made sure his camera cut off at his waist before his naked legs. </p>

<p>After waiting ten minutes with no calls, he stood up to go and make a fresh brew, but as he did he received a call from his Dean, which, for some reason, answered itself automatically. </p>

<p>The Dean’s face suggested that Jenson had been too late sitting down. “Balls”, they both said aloud. After a brief call, they agreed to talk again in an hour. There wasn’t really anything to discuss, but they needed to appear busy. </p>

<p>Just then, another call came through from the Head of Prospectus Fulfilment. She explained that the university had over ten thousand prospectuses in the stores, but with UCAS fairs cancelled they had to find innovative new ways to distribute them to prospective students. </p>

<p>It had been suggested that because Jenson had a light aircraft license, he could airdrop them over local towns and village. Jenson questioned as to whether this would be classed as essential travel, and the face on the other end of the call nodded sheepishly.</p>

<p>It was now Friurday, or maybe Sonday (who knew), and Jenson sat in his Cessna 172 at the end of Bantshire Airport runway, loaded up with five hundred prospectuses and five hundred mini parachutes. </p>

<p>Chocks away! </p>

<p>Twenty seven minutes later, Jenson was cruising at 12,000ft approaching Blackpool, Lancashire. This drop was planned to be 69 prospectuses, but as the plane banked left the bundle of remaining prospectuses - all 371 of them - tumbled out of the open door. </p>

<p>Bollocks, Jenson shouted down his radio. </p>

<p>Jenson landed twenty seven minutes later and turned on the TV. The news was showing live scenes as police were sealing off the area in front of the Tower.</p>

<p>The End.</p>

<hr class="major" />

<p><h2>Dress-down Friday</h2></p>

<p>It was dress-down Friday, and Marketing Assistant Jenson had decided to surprise his colleagues by wearing his most outrageous floral Hawaiian shirt, paired with tailor-made work shorts that were cut off a good few inches above the knee. But little did Jenson know that he’d been delegated a last minute invite to the bimonthly Faculty of Commerce management meeting. </p>

<p>Fucks sake, Jenson thought to himself as he dashed through the drizzle to the Vince Cable Building. </p>

<p>Once inside, he had a quick splash of Old Spice and pulled the meeting room door handle, rattling the frame. No luck. It was a push door. He shoved it forcefully, slamming it against the wall behind, and strolled through.</p>

<p>He sat down, making sure there was an empty chair on either side of him to act as a buffer to the next person. The Dean’s Assistant, Bev, stared at Jenson. In the far corner Jeff and Geoff were helping themselves to a lukewarm coffee left over from the previous meeting, and Kelly was sat opposite, wistfully staring out of the window at the concrete wall outside. </p>

<p>Jenson pretended to check his work emails. </p>

<p>The meeting finally started, 15 minutes late, once the Dean has turned up with a Matcha Pumpkin Latte. He announced that he’d brought donuts, and laughed. He hadn’t brought donuts. </p>

<p>Bev distributed reams of background material, printed in full colour and on one side only. </p>

<p>The first topic of discussion was undergraduate recruitment. The Dean was agitated that his new course, a BA in Music and Leisure Centre Management, had failed to attract any applicants. This was clearly a Marketing issue, as his desk-based research last May had proven there was a gap in the market. He fixed Jenson a long hard stare as he sipped his latte. </p>

<p>At this exact same moment, there was a loud noise from above as a leg came crashing through the ceiling, followed by a cry of “argghfucksakesrgg”. As the dust settled, the leg retrieved itself back into the ceiling, and there was the sound of crawling. </p>

<p>A few seconds passed and there was a further creak, and through the ceiling fell Chief IT Engineer Barry, landing on Bev’s lap.</p>

<p>The End.</p>

<p><h2>Working at home</h2></p>

<p>For many of us, working at home whilst living in close quarters with our families is a fucking nightmare. Even more so when you have children to look after.</p>

<p>Our Policy Innovation Strategy Officer (PISoff) - who was once a child himself - has written these top tips on looking after your little shits whilst working at home: </p>

<p>1) Whilst delivering video lectures on Great Philosophers of the Twentieth Century, set up a screen in another room for your three-year-old to enjoy the works of Wittgenstein, Quine, Davidson, Collingwood, or Heidegger. </p>

<p>2) Consider moving your home office into a lockable room, such as the bathroom. You could even co-locate with your spouse. Put a sign on the door so your two-year-old understands that you’re both busy until 5pm, and there are Pot Noddles in the cupboard. </p>

<p>3) Working from home might mean your kids have a bit more screen time – and that’s OK. We recommend a minimum of 7 hours of Peppa Pig a day for children under 5. </p>

<p>4) Working at home means flexible hours. If you want to get up at 5am to catch up on emails before homeschooling your kids, then stay up until midnight to catch up again, that is absolutely your decision which we fully support. </p>

<p>5) We understand that you might not get as much work done as usual. However, we noticed that you missed the deadline we set you yesterday. We’ll be in touch... </p>
